Comments on this data set
=========================

The data set puts trees in a middle tree layer without any other layers (upper and lower tree layer) being present.
Hence, occurrences within the middle tree layer have been elevated to an upper tree layer.
Stand descriptions, although, indicate a low tree layer.
Maybe these are coppice or brushwood forests (see the informative remarks field).
